"""
Named priority profiles for candidate dispatch ordering.

Each profile is a weight vector over five signals:
  score       — most recent upstream stage score (primary quality signal)
  surrogate   — surrogate model prediction
  uncertainty — surrogate uncertainty (drives active learning)
  age         — time since enqueue (anti-starvation bonus)
  diversity   — novelty bonus for under-represented scaffold classes (MMR-style)

Higher weight → that signal contributes more to the candidate's priority score
when the sharder ranks its buffer for dispatch.

Ported from cm-prototype/src/cm/plan/profiles.py; weights are unchanged.
