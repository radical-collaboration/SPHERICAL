"""Structured campaign plan (Planner → CM contract).

The Plan is the read-only specification that the upstream Planner emits and
the CM executes within.  This subpackage provides:

  schema.py  — dataclass-based plan model (CampaignPlan + nested specs)
  loader.py  — YAML loading with back-compat for legacy flat configs

When pydantic is added to the project, schema.py can be ported to BaseModel
without changing public APIs.
